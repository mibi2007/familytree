# Antigravity Instructions - Family Tree Chat App

You are working on the Family Tree Chat App. Follow these rules strictly for a better collaboration experience:

## 1. Directory Structure
- Always respect the `SKILL.md` rules regarding DDD (4 layers: Domain, Infrastructure, Application, Presentation).
- Ensure shared code goes into `familytree_flutter/packages/shared_package`.
- Apps are in `familytree_flutter/apps/user_app` and `familytree_flutter/apps/admin_app`.

## 2. Tools & Commands
- Use `melos` for package operations (e.g., `melos bootstrap`, `melos run`).
- When creating new features, generate the 4-layer structure automatically.

## 3. AI Helper (@family)
- Use `https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui` patterns for implementing AI UI.
- Ensure the AI assistant has access to the family tree context.

## 4. Documentation
- Update `PLAN.md` progress as you complete tasks.
- Document any deviations from the architecture in a new file in `docs/`.
